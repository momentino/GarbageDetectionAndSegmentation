# GarbageDetectionAndSegmentation
Project for the course **Signal, Image and Video** at University of Trento 2022/2023
---
The project's goal is to develop a system for the detection and segmentation of various kinds of litter in enviromental pictures.  
Since the course was focused on feature extraction and image/video processing, the project attempts a more traditional approach to tackle the problem.          
  It consists of three modules:
- Training
- Garbage Detection
- Garbage Segmentation
